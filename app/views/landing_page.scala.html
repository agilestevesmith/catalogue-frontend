    <h1>About the catalogue</h1>
    <p>The catalogue is a resource you can use to find information about teams working on the Tax Platform and the
        services they own.</p>
    <p>Currently you can browse a list of teams or a list of services (which you can search using your browser) and drill down to access links to Jenkins, Travis
        &amp; Github for each service belonging to that team.</p>
    <p>This service is currently in an early alpha phase, and needs your feedback in order to improve. If you have
        anything to offer, or find something wrong, you can contact us in the
        <a href="https://hmrcdigital.slack.com/messages/team-platops/" target="_blank">#team-platops</a>
        room in Slack.</p>
    <h2>How is the catalogue maintained?</h2>
    <p>We use team and repository information from Github open and Github Enterprise in order to programatically build the catalogue.
    If you notice something is not quite right, you can usually fix it by updating Github directly.<p>
    <p>We reload the catalogue once every hour, so you may need to wait a little while until your changes take effect.</p>
